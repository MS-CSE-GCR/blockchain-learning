# Ethereum Web3.js & smart contract samples

Before you start to run the node.js sample code, you have to deploy your smart contract. My demo smart contract is located in /smartcontract folder. Install truffle and follow [instruction](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/building-testing-frontend-app-truffle-3) to [deploy smart contract](https://truffle.readthedocs.io/en/beta/getting_started/migrations/) to your Ethereum network.

Once you have smart contract deployed to Ethereum network, you can run the node.js sample:

```javascript
cd nodeapp
npm install
node smartContractClient.js
```
